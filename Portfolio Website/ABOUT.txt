It lays out my completed projects, competencies and provides information about my career. 
The site was made using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 
I used Bootstrap to simple and increase the production of the website. 
I am hosting the site on AWS. 
I am consistently creating updates and changing the site as needed.
